Description: The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) records data associated with
    section 7 consultations under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the
    Public Consultation Tracking System (PCTS) database.  Biological opinions describing the consultation 
    process and outcomes per species are written at the end of all formal consultations.
    This dataset contains serves as a crosswalk for contradictory/confusing combinations of jeopardy and
    adverse modification determinations recorded in PCTS to true determinations.  True determinations were
    ascertained by reading sample biological opinions.  If conversions between recorded combinations and true determinations were 
    inconsistent, crosswalks were constructed per NMFS region.
